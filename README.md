# Smart-Helmet
Designing a helmet which when actually worn will allow the rider to start his/her vehicle. 

This project was taken up by me to solve the problem of Indian riders mainly who donot tend to wear a helmet while riding a bike.

The system is smart enough to understand whether someone is actually wearing a helmet or not by using simple sensing technologies.

The aim of the project was also to keep it as simple as possible using off-the-shelf readily available technologies.
